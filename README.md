Finally, the viewer can leave a message along with an e-mail and name, the email input has validation to ensure the viewer doesnt enter mock e-mails, and the textboxes wont allow empty strings, if the viewer attemps to do any of the above a message will display.
The viewer will be able to access my GitHub, LinkedIn or Twitter accounts from the footer, which is available at all times.(Only Github will direct the viewer to my personal account, LinkedIn and Twitter will show their home pages),
